# Login To SonicWall

## Wat is dis?

 - I hate how my school's sonicwall policy kicks me out after 3 hours on ethernet so this is a script to log in every hour to keep the connection alive.

## How do i use??

 - Install python3
 - Run setup.bat
 - Run run.bat
 - ???
 - Profit

## How do i update??

 - If you haven't yet pls install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
 - Run update.bat

## y it no work after restart

 - cos it not running
 - if you want it to run on startup, run `startup.bat` and it will create a shortcut in your startup folder
